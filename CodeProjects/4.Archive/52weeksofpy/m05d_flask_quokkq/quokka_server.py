# READ THIS: Don't do this. By that I mean, don't use global variables in a flask application.
#            The reason: flask is by nature, multi-threaded. Each REST request will operate on
#            it's own thread. So you could have multiple threads attempting to write global data.
#            That's a bad, bad idea.
#            In the next lessons, we'll be replacing this data with an SQL database. And reads
#            and writes to the database are safe.
